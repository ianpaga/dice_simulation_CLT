Roll Dice Simulation and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
====

Description: """
    Simulates rolling a specified number of dice multiple times and computes the average of the outcomes for each roll.

    Parameters:
    - num_rolls (int): Number of times to roll the dice.
    - num_dice (int): Number of dice to roll in each trial.

    Returns:
    - averages (numpy.ndarray): Array containing the average outcome of each trial.
    """
    
 More about the Central Limit Theorem and this particular example of dice rolls is nicely explained in this [video from 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeJD6dqJ5lo&t=495s).
